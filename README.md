Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, 
we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.’ 
By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,'
'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),'
this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.
